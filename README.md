## About the project

This project is a web-based version of the classic **Guess Who?** game, where players attempt to deduce the identity of their opponent's character by asking strategic yes/no questions,
but with a twist. In this version you can join one of two teams to play together with your friends and upload your own images to make the game more enjoyable.

The frontend is built using modern web technologies and provides an intuitive interface for a fun and engaging game experience.
It communicates with the [Guess Who Backend API](https://github.com/Dantomaz/guess-who) to manage game states and multiplayer interactions.
